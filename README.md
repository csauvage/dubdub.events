## 🤝 A Community for Everyone

The Apple developer ecosystem is a vibrant and welcoming space filled with talented individuals. During WWDC25, we want to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate in events, share their projects, or connect with others who are passionate about building great software.

That’s the reason we created this repo — to unite community-led WWDC events, essential resources, and valuable content from creators like SwiftUI Lab, Hacking with Swift, Donny Wals, Swift with Majid, and many more. We’d love to feature your contributions as well!

## 💡 Why This Exists

The Swift community is amazing — but sometimes it can feel driven by just a few personalities. We started this repo to amplify everyone’s voice: to highlight *your* content, meetups, and ideas.

WWDC isn’t just about Apple announcements — it’s about the community. That shared sense of wonder and excitement is what makes this week truly special.

So whether it’s your first blog post, your tenth video, or your first time organizing a lunch meetup — **we want to hear from you**.

## 🔧 Who Can Merge Your PR?

For now, this repo is maintained by me. I'm happy to add people with some Swift experience (ideally with a public GitHub profile or presence on X.com/Bluesky) and preferably previous WWDC experience. You are still the heart of this project.

Interested in helping merge PRs? We’d love to hear from you — especially if you’re part of an underrepresented group in tech 💜

**🚀 Clever Cloud: Your DevOps Superpower in the Cloud**

Clever Cloud is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) designed to make developers’ lives easier—and honestly, more fun. Forget the headaches of provisioning, scaling, patching, or setting up alerts at 2 a.m. Clever Cloud automates all that, so you can focus on shipping code, not fighting servers. Supporting over 25 languages—including Node.js, Python, PHP, Go, Rust, **and Swift** and more—it gives you the freedom to build in whatever stack you love most. 

And here’s where it gets even cooler: our own website and serverless API and production-grade database are hosted on Clever Cloud, powered by their home-grown innovation: **[MateriaDB](https://www.clever-cloud.com/fr/materia-serverless/)**. MateriaDB is a serverless, fully-managed, and *scalable-to-infinity* database system that grows with your needs—no cold starts, no lock-in, and no setup fuss. Compatible with Redis today (and soon DynamoDB and GraphQL), it’s like getting a Swiss Army knife for your data, minus the cuts.

It’s built on FoundationDB, distributed across multiple datacenters, and designed to be robust, lightning-fast, and developer-friendly out of the box.

Bonus: everything is ISO 27001:2022 certified, fully GDPR-compliant, and hosted in Europe—so your data sovereignty is never in question. Oh, and pricing? It’s per-second billing, meaning you only pay for what you use. Clever, right?
