# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Values
We believe in trust, respect, collaboration, and transparency as foundational values guiding our open source community. We welcome participants from around the globe, embracing diverse experiences, perspectives, and innovative ideas.

## Our Pledge
To foster an open, welcoming, and inclusive environment, we as contributors and maintainers commit to making participation in our project and community free from harassment for everyone, irrespective of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behaviors that contribute positively include:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Prioritizing collaboration over conflict
- Focusing on community benefit
- Showing empathy and kindness

**Examples of unacceptable behaviors include:**

- Violence, threats, or inciting self-harm
- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances
- Trolling, deliberate misinformation, insults, derogatory remarks, or personal and political attacks
- Harassment in any form, public or private
- Publishing personal information without explicit permission
- Abuse of the reporting process to harass or exclude others
- Encouraging any of the above behaviors
- Other conduct deemed inappropriate in a professional context

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying acceptable standards of behavior and taking fair, appropriate corrective actions against unacceptable behaviors.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They also may temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behaviors considered inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and public areas where individuals represent the project or community. Representation includes using official project communications (emails, social media, forums), or participating officially at online and offline events. Project maintainers may further define and clarify what constitutes representation.

## Enforcement

Report any incidents of abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior anonymously through [this form/link]. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in appropriate responses according to the situation. Confidentiality of the reporting individual will be maintained.

Maintainers who do not enforce or follow this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other leadership members.

If unsure whether an incident constitutes a violation, or whether it occurred within the scope of this Code of Conduct, please report it nonetheless. We'd rather address concerns proactively than risk participants feeling unsafe or unwelcome. Reports that ultimately aren't deemed violations help improve this Code of Conduct and related processes. If you witness dangerous behavior or someone in distress, please report immediately, even if you are only an observer.
